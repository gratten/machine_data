Bare-bones web application for tracking machine serial numbers and kits

Immediate benefits
- simpler interface for updating machine data
- cleaner and more uniform data, dictated by application logic
- central repository for all machine data, accessible site-wide
	> logins can differentiate write and read-only capabilities
- can relatively easily import data from existing spread sheets

Future goals
- tie to electronic CDR process
	> logging and approving carton size data within application could replace emailing word documents back and forth
	> engineering approval check box could be implemented to replace signatures
- database advantages over spreadsheets
	> databases can by queried and linked to other databases, ideally read and write (agile, dbworks, everntually SAP and other CDM system)
	> automated template creation for standard 'field kits' and custom fits BOMS
		> for example, generate part numbers for the gate assembly and gate plate, populate descriptions according to data, then build the BOM in Agile
		> the goal is to minimize data-entry, copy-paste, etc
- machine cookbook
	> central repository for all options for a machine, ideally modularized
	> could eventually tie to existing Agile boms (read-only access to Agile database) allowing user to link modules together to create a machine
	> logic could be implemented to ensure that only corresponding modules are allowed
	
Proposed path
- features left to implement
	> search box
	> multiple product line support (new data field on add machine page)
	> serial number building functionality (would require list of options for machines)
	> pagination
	> user logins
	> delete functionality
- trail period with Enterprise and MEC?
	
IT support requirements
- proxy information so that github can be used directly onsite
- deployment strategy? deploy on intranet? cloud deployment?

Other notes
- location of formal project proposal document, for this and data cleansing/Agile import tool
- other possible applications
	> sales order and PC sheet generation - seems mostly copy-paste at the moment
	> engineering time management
